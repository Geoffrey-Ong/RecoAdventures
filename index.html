                    I didn’t know parks here still exist! Knowing how advanced we are already, I thought these things were already gone, 
                    but I guess I was wrong hehe.


                    <span class="desc-read-more">Master took me here today, 
                    saying that it’s his favorite place to unwind and forget about things.I can definitely agree with him!
                    It still gives off the feeling of parks I’ve read from books back then. I wonder what he wants to forget though… </span>

                        We are so high up!!! I never expected we were made so high up! I was always in a secluded room with no windows, so I never saw the outside before. 
                        
                        <span class="desc-read-more">This is the first time I’m seeing it when my master **!#!!@!# me… 
                        We must be really important if we were this high up…

                        …How could have it come to this…? I guess the rain was calming… It's been awhile since I felt like this... 
    
    
                        <span class="desc-read-more">I wonder how’s master is doing… I can still remember the look on his eyes when I was taken away… it was anger… 
                        Will he remember me? Even if I’m just another product? Another accessory? Another play thing for other rich people? Another war machine thats only purpose is to fight…?
                        …….He must be awfully worried about me. I always wondered, what was the point of this war that I’m approaching? What is it that I can gain?... </span>
